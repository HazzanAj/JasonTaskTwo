Converting Json data To Object . This project is quite an interesting one especially for those who are working as API specialist or aspiring to. API stands for Application interface.
to get json data ie streams of data which can be ( String, Int, or Boolean) from your the Backend you need good understanding of APIs. One very good example of  useful APIs for Application Development is Joke APIs 
more examples on this can be seen here (https://rapidapi.com/blog/most-popular-api/). For APIs Developers one of the most popular collaboration platform for API development is Postman API, which allows you to develope
and test your own APIs and also document them for reuseability.

In this project, I developed a model (an Object) called Music with many fields or attributes or properties which were converted to json data. In the second implementations, I converted the Json data into an object called
(musicOut.json), and it was saved in (the target path) I created, it was a bit challenging but very interesting and useful project to deepens one's knowledge on Json data.
